# 7mer-word-chains
This notebook generates a graph where nodes represent 7-mer sequences (7-character DNA subsequences) and edges indicate single-sequence transitions (e.g., AAA â†’ AAC). It provides a framework for visualizing and analyzing how these 7-mer sequences evolve by small changes, offering insights into nucleotide transformations.
