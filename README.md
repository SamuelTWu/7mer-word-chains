# 7-mer Word Chains
This notebook generates a graph where nodes represent 7-mer sequences (7-character DNA subsequences) and edges indicate single-sequence transitions (e.g., AAA â†’ AAC). It provides a framework for visualizing and analyzing how these 7-mer sequences evolve by small changes, offering insights into nucleotide transformations.

## Key features:

Graph generation of 7-mer sequences.
Visualization of sequence evolution via single-character changes.
Exploration of nucleotide transition pathways.

## Utilizing Data
In addition to building the graph, the notebook integrates RNA-binding protein (RBP) data. For a set of 7-mers determined by the network, we calculate the mean RBP values, providing a deeper understanding of how these sequences relate to protein interactions.
